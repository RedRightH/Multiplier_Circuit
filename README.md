This repository will contain the implementation of Dadda and Wallace multiplier

Successfully implemented the Dadda multiplier 4x4 on my own. I have only referred the Wikipedia page while figuring out the digital logic design of the multiplier.
Really enjoyed working on this project. Will now focus on implementing the similar wallace multiplier(...for a later day)
